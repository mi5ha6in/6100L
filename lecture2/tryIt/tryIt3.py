# YOU TRY IT!
# Write a program that
# Asks the user for a verb
# Prints “I can _ better than you” where you replace _ with the verb.
# Then prints the verb 5 times in a row separated by spaces.
# For example, if the user enters run, you print:
# I can run better than you!
# run run run run run


verb = input("Enter a verb: ")
print(f"I can {verb} better than you!")
print((verb + " ") * 4 + verb)
